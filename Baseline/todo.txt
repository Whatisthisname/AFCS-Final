how tf do we evaluate over each product? 
one of the helper functions probably does so but didn't get time to look at those in detail

note:
our lives becomes a bit more simple, ets models don't work with regression the same way as arima does
So we won't use it for dynamic regression


Todo
helper functions!

log transform is now fucked
need to look at residuals of final model
need to keep in mind differencing for arima PDQ and pdq
look at harmonics

combine train and validation to train final model before testing
confidence intervals?
neural networks?

RUN ON WHOLE TRAIN
